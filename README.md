# uBuild Hugo Theme

`ubuild-hugo` is a Hugo theme designed to work with [Forestry](https://forestry.io/)'s [Blocks](https://forestry.io/blog/blocks-give-your-editors-the-power-to-build-pages/) feature.  This theme provides a set of page-level components and a pre-configured Forestry Blocks UI that will empower content editors to construct their own webpages.

## Getting Started

[Clone the starter site](https://github.com/forestryio/ubuild-hugo-starter), or:

1. Add this theme as a submodule: `git init && git submodule add git@github.com:forestryio/ubuild-hugo.git themes/ubuild-hugo`
2. Copy the `.forestry/` directory to the top-level of your Hugo site
3. [Sign up for a free Forestry account](https://app.forestry.io/signup)
4. [Import your repo](https://forestry.io/docs/quickstart/setup-site/#import-site-from-repo) as a new Hugo project

To use the page builder, select the **Page Builder** template when creating a new page.
